## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference



## My process
built with native JS, CSS using VS Code

Fist I designed the header, the theme switcher then I moved to the cards. After those were done, my major problems became sizing and positioning but once I figured out the most important thing divs are useful for(containing), problems became blessing to finish this challenge.

### What I learned

I revisited alot of techniques I had forgotten in CSS with this project. I'm jactually a beginner but I abandoned programming for 8months (One century in programming time) so I've had to relearn many things. This project thought me the usefulness and using divs to contain multiple items so styling becomes easy and things move along as you go. 



### Continued development

I'll like to learn more about positioning in CSS. It is very important to any project yet the available options are very confusing to me as they seem to change my entire design as I switch between them. I found away using divs but going forward, I want to know exactly what I'm doing when choosing any position for an element or div.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](stackoverflow.com) - Most of the questions I had about divs were already answered on this site. Also, I was able to combine help from thew site with my basic knowledge of Javascript in making the theme switcher work.
- [resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - I used many articles on this site for relearning some things about creating a theme switcher.
- [resource 3](https://dev.to/ananyaneogi/create-a-dark-light-mode-switch-with-css-variables-34l8) - This opened my mind to using custom variables in css as many many other articles about using custom variables were clogged with unecessary terms that confuses learners or even scare them away from using custom variables.
- [resource 4] - (freecodecamp.org) - Through Quincy Larsson's weekly news letter, I discovered a video by "coderCoder" she, 'coderCoder' led me to frontendmentor in her video about this project.

## Acknowledgments

I'll like to think I completed this project by myself as the code prints all over this reeks of a beginner's ink. If I had followed anyone's solution, I would have finished faster and looked more professional but without much experience.

Nothwithstanding, thanks to "CoderCoder" for introducing me to frontendmentor. Feels like I found a place to build my skills.
